# Two Factor Authentication tool

This is a simple Python application that generates a QR code for Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) using the TOTP algorithm. You can use this application to secure your accounts with an additional layer of authentication.

## Features

- Generate a QR code for TOTP-based 2FA.
- Verify OTPs generated from authenticator apps.
- User-friendly GUI built with Tkinter.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- `pyotp` library
- `qrcode` library
- `Pillow` library (for image handling)
- `tkinter` (usually included with Python installations)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AshenDulsanka/two-factor-authentication-tool
   cd two-factor-authentication-tool
   ```

2. **Install the required dependencies:**

    You can install the dependencies using pip. Run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    pip install pyotp qrcode pillow
    ```

3. **Run the application:**

    Execute the Python script to start the 2FA app:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage

1. **Enter Your Name or Email:**

Launch the application, and you will see a text box labeled "Enter your name or email." Type your name or email address in this field.

2. **Generate QR Code:**

Click the "Generate QR Code" button. A QR code will be generated and displayed in the application window.

3. **Scan the QR Code:**

Use an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Authy) on your smartphone to scan the QR code. The app will now generate time-based OTPs for your account.

4. **Verify OTP:**

Enter the OTP generated by your authenticator app into the "Scan the QR Code and enter the OTP" field in the application and click the "Verify OTP" button. The application will indicate whether the OTP is valid or invalid.


## Code Overview

The application is built using the following Python libraries:

- **`pyotp`**: Generates time-based OTPs compliant with the TOTP standard.
- **`qrcode`**: Generates QR codes from the TOTP URI.
- **`tkinter`**: Provides the graphical user interface (GUI) components.
- **`Pillow`**: Handles image processing for displaying the QR code.


### Main Components of the Code

- **Key Generation:** The app uses a predefined secret key (**`JBSWY3DPEHPK3PXP`**) to generate TOTP tokens. You can replace this key with your own secret for more security.
- **QR Code Generation:** The **`gen_qr()`** function creates a provisioning URI, generates a QR code from it, and displays it in the GUI.
- **OTP Verification:** The **`verify_otp()`** function verifies the user-entered OTP against the TOTP generated by the secret key.


## Customization

You can customize the app by changing the following:

- **Secret Key:** Replace the hardcoded **`key`** variable with your secret key.
- **Issuer Name:** Modify the **`issuer_name`** parameter in the provisioning_uri method to match your application's name.


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, ensure that:

- All dependencies are installed correctly.
- You are running the application with Python 3.x.
- Your system's clock is synchronized, as TOTP relies on time-based calculations.
